### Udacity Personal Blog Project

Personal blog project to display CSS and HTML skills. I chose to do a website that lists all my favorite music, movies, and television shows.

## Project Requirements

- CSS separate from HTML with at least 3 CSS imports
- Flexbox and Grids Layout
- Responsive design for web, tablet, and mobile displays

## Description

I wanted to make a blog where I could write about the things is popular culture that I feel that it is mandatory for people to know. I used a simplistic color scheme (white, black, and yellow highlights) so that the colors would come from the various pictures for the posts and not clash. In the future I want to expand it to include the color scheme and fonts of the selected media.
